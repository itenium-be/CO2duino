# Set up an access point

To get an historical view of our data (maybe to see some trends) we need to log our data. In this example we'll use ThingSpeak as a host to log our sensor data. They provide some nice graphs and a generous free tier. Check out the tutorial below and log your CO2 and TVOC data every 10 seconds to ThingSpeak.

> **Note** A hardcoded ThingSpeak URL is fine for the moment, we'll make it configurable in a next exercise
