# Set up an access point

Since we want to be able to move our CO2 meter, we can't always hardcode our WiFi network into the program.

[WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) is an Arduino library we can use to allow the user to connect to the CO2 meter and then select their home WiFi network. Check out the provided tutorial and github link to let the user select their own WiFi network when the CO2 meter starts up.
