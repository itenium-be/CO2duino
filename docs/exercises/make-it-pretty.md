# Make it pretty

In this exercise we'll try to make our displayed result a bit prettier. Check out the display libraries' documentation below and make it your own!

Some ideas:

- Try to use the icons provided in the `icons.h` file
- Let the user know if the device is connected to the WiFi with an icon
- Blink a warning sign if the measured CO2 is over 800
- Try out some fonts!
